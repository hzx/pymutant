Overview
========

Mutant language is domain specific language, aims to abstract languages
distinction and focus on problem solving (interface, reactive systems
development).

Code validate by parser grammar rules. Source code parse to code tree
and translate by generators to specific language (python, coffeescript,
c++). Generators map mutant semantic nodes to specific language nodes.
